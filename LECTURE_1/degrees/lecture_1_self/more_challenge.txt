âœ… 1. Word Ladder II (All Shortest Paths) â€” BFS with Backtracking
Problem: Return all shortest transformation sequences from start to goal.

Input: start = "hit", goal = "cog", dictionary = {...}

Output:

python
Copy code
[["hit", "hot", "dot", "dog", "cog"], ["hit", "hot", "lot", "log", "cog"]]
ðŸ“Œ This requires BFS to find the shortest level, and backtracking to find all paths.






âœ… 2. Maze Solver with DFS & BFS (You Choose Start and Goal)
Write a program that takes any maze grid (as a 2D list) and lets the user specify a start and goal. Implement both:

DFS: show any path (not necessarily shortest)

BFS: show the shortest path

Try with walls (#), free spaces ( ), start (A), goal (B)

âœ… 3. Knightâ€™s Shortest Path (Chessboard BFS)
Given a chessboard and a starting square, find the shortest number of moves a knight needs to reach a target square.

Input: start = (0,0), end = (7,7)
Output: 6 (minimum knight moves)

ðŸ“Œ This teaches movement in 2D space with non-obvious rules.

âœ… 4. Word Morph Puzzle (Custom Dictionary)
Given:

python
Copy code
start = "cold"
goal = "warm"
dictionary = {"cold", "cord", "card", "ward", "warm", "core", "care"}
Find the shortest transformation path from "cold" to "warm" using valid words. Only one letter can change at a time.

âœ… 5. Graph Traversal â€” Adjacency List Format
Given a graph like:

python
Copy code
graph = {
  "A": ["B", "C"],
  "B": ["A", "D", "E"],
  "C": ["A", "F"],
  "D": [],
  "E": ["F"],
  "F": []
}
Write:

bfs(graph, start="A") â†’ returns visit order

dfs(graph, start="A") â†’ returns visit order

âœ… 6. Water Jug Problem (State Space BFS)
You have:

A 4-liter jug

A 3-liter jug

You must measure exactly 2 liters using these operations:

Fill, Empty, Pour

Return a sequence of states showing how to get 2 liters in one jug.

ðŸ“Œ This is state-space search, like AI search problems.

âœ… 7. Find the Shortest Binary Path
Given a grid of 0s and 1s, where 1 is walkable and 0 is wall:

python
Copy code
grid = [
  [1, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 1]
]
Start: (0, 0)
Goal: (2, 2)

Return the length of shortest path of 1s. Use BFS.

Would you like me to generate starter code for one of these now?
